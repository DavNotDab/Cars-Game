# Cars-Game
A funny little 2D cars game.

This is a little game I made a while ago, when I was just 5 months into Python.
It's not perfect but you can have a little fun with it, specially if you have a friend to play with.

You can choose between three different gamemodes.
The first one is classic race, you can choose the number of lives and laps you want, and the first to complete the laps without losing all his lives wins.
The second one is time trial race, you run against the clock to get the fastest time. You can save your time when you finish the game.
The third one is Versus mode. In this mode laps doesn't matter. The first to deplete all his lives loses. It's a bit of a crazy mode.
